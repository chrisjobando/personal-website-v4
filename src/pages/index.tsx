        <p>
          As a first-generation Hispanic-American and college graduate, I love to give back to the communities that got
          me to where I am now. During my time at Georgia Tech, I have been able to serve the greater-Atlanta area as a
          Latinx in STEM mentor, shelter volunteer, and as a web developer for several nonprofits through my extensive
          involvement with Bits of Good.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have over three years of experience with React.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python,
          and was a Teaching Assistant for a game-development course in C. I have also taken several courses in User
          Interface Design, Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, and Accessible User Design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My experience in front-end development and UX design allows for me to communicate with both designers and
          developers from their perspectives. I have worked on multi-disciplinary teams as a Senior Web Developer,
          Backend Software Engineer, an Accessibility-Focused Designer, and most-recently, as a Native Fullstack
          Application Developer.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With high standards for user experience, knowledge of WCAG 2.1 compliance requirements, and experience with
          testing frameworks, I have consistently delivered secure, engaging, and accessible digital products.
