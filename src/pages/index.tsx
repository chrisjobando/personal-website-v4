          <p>
            As a first-generation Hispanic-American and college graduate, I love to give back to the communities that
            got me to where I am now. During my time at Georgia Tech, I have been able to serve the greater-Atlanta area
            as a Latinx in STEM mentor, shelter volunteer, a web developer for Code for Atlanta, and as a designer for
            several nonprofits through my extensive involvement with Bits of Good.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have over three years of experience with React.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python,
            and was a Teaching Assistant for a game-development course in C. I have also taken several courses in User
            Interface Design, Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, and Accessible User Design.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My experience in front-end development and UX design allows for me to communicate with both designers and
            developers from their perspectives. I have worked on multi-disciplinary teams as a Senior Web Developer,
            Backend Software Engineer, an Accessibility-Focused Designer, and most-recently, as a Native Fullstack
            Application Developer.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With high standards for user experience, knowledge of WCAG 2.1 compliance requirements, and experience with
            testing frameworks, I have consistently delivered secure, engaging, and accessible digital products.
