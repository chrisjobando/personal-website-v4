# Â¡Hola, soy Chris!

As a first-generation Hispanic-American and college graduate, I love to give back to the communities that got me to where I am now. During my time at Georgia Tech, I have been able to serve the greater-Atlanta area as a Latinx in STEM mentor, shelter volunteer, a web developer for Code for Atlanta, and as a designer for several nonprofits through my extensive involvement with Bits of Good.

<br />

I have over three years of experience with React.js, React Native, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and was a Teaching Assistant for a game-development course in C. I have also taken several courses in User Interface Design, Computer Graphics, Computer Animation, and Accessible User Design.

<br />

My experience in front-end development and UX design allows for me to communicate with both designers and developers from their perspectives. I have worked on multi-disciplinary teams as a Senior Web Developer, Backend Software Engineer, an Accessibility-Focused Designer, and most-recently, as a Native Fullstack Application Developer.

<br />

With high standards for user experience, knowledge of WCAG 2.1 compliance requirements, and experience with testing frameworks, I have consistently delivered secure, engaging, and accessible digital products.
